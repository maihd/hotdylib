Hot reload for dynamic library. Written in C99.

FAQs
----
- Why new library instead of use cr?
  - I want to create to understand mechanic of hot reload in C/C++. This project follow 2 principles of MaiCstyle: self-reliance and immediate feedback.

- Is it production ready? 
  - Only for development: yes. For user production: No. Because many platforms not accept application load dynamic library in runtime. And there no showcase in final production yet.
